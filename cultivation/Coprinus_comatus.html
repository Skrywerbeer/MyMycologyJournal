	<h1>Coprinus comatus</h1>
	<p>
	  Probably one of the easest mushrooms to identify. Its rapdily liquifying
	  body and true to its name shaggy appearance, although I have noticed that
	  very small fruit bodies have smooth caps still maintaining the telltale
	  elongated shape.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A sort of spore print that cultures can be started from, can be made by
	  letting a drop of the black goo drip onto a sheet of aluminium foil. Try
	  to keep the conditions and surfaces as clean as possible also keep the
	  sample covered while allowing for air flow as it is drying to minimize the
	  number of contaminants. Folded over and the edges lightly crimped, the
	  foil is easily stored.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A culture will grow happily on any grain and will even fruit once all of
	  the substrate has been colonized.
