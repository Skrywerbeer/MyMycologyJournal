	<h1>Plearotus ostreatus</h1>
	<p>
	  A friend of a friend that also has an interest in mushrooms was kind
	  enough to gift me a piece of oyster mushroom from his harvest. I started
	  my culture by placing a largish piece above an open, sterile jar with
	  barley as substrate. This setup was left inside my oven for a day. This
	  left the top surface of the substrate covered with a thick layer of light
	  grey spores. In retrospect waiting a whole day might be excessive given
	  how many spores dropped P. ostreatus's reputation for heavy spore load.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Subsequent subculturing has left me with a strong strain that I have even
	  witnesed defeating Aspergillus mold.
