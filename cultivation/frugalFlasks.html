	<h1>ü•úFrugal Flasksü´ô</h1>
	<p>
	  I love peanut butter, I can't get enough of it(unsalted and unsweetened
	  only). Thanks to this and the fact that a certain brandüêà sells theirs in
	  glass jars; I have a near constant supply of flasks for culturing fungi
	  in.
	</p>
	<p>
	  With a small 6 mm hole drilled in the lid plugged with a ball of polyester
	  filter floss.  I have yet to experiment with the hole size but so far 6 mm
	  has proven more than sufficient and is a convienent size for a decent ball
	  of floss. The even has the advantage of being injectable if you happen to
	  have liquid culture.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you lose the lid or the hole rusts away and becomes too big. A single
	  layer of aluminium foil that is tied down with twine after inoculation and
	  poked through with a needle for gas exchange is a workable substitute, not
	  as convenient because you have to undo the tiwne each time to open the
	  jar. The floss will not work for the foil. Use paper towel folded once or
	  twice with the edges taped down instead. And if you kept your pin pricks
	  confined to a small area you only need stamp sized square.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I have yet to try it myself, but the cloth used for waterproofing roofs is
	  made of polyester and might be a reusable, pressure cooker proof
	  alternative to paper.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are fancier ways to achieve the same thing; actual labratory
	  glassware, silicone ports, etc. but are they needed? For amateur
	  cultivationn not really.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Of course it doesn't have to be a peanut butter jar; any glass recepticale
	  of reasonable geometry that fits in your pressure cooker will work. I just
	  like the ones filled with peanut butter the most.
