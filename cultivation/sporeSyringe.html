	<h1>üçÑSpore Syringeüíâ</h1>
	<p>
	  Aluminium foil is a great substrate for making spore prints. The metallic
	  surface allows most colours of spores to clearly show, no need for white
	  and black paper. It is waterproof and can be steam cleaned. Also it is
	  Airtight and unreactive under the conditions considered. The waterproof
	  nature also makes it easy to efficiently use the spores for creating
	  cultures.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Fill a syringe with sterile water, if you just finished sterilizing jars
	  filled with growth medium you have ample sterile water in the pot, put a
	  drop of water somewhere on the edge of the print and using the needle
	  gently mix up the spores into the droplet. When the spores have been
	  freely dispersed suck up the drop keeping the needle bevel faced down to
	  maximize the amount of water pulled up. Gently turn the syringe upside
	  down and back again a few times to distribute the spores into the full
	  volume of the water, having an air bubble in the barrel helps to speed up
	  the mixing.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Evenly inoculating growth medium is now as easy as squirting some liquid
	  over it. I find 1 cc syringes a convenient size and the small gauge
	  needle squirts a fine stream with a controlable low flow rate.
