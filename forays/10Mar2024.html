		  This find of
		  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprinellus_micaceus">Coprinellus micaceus</a>
		  is thanks to my dog and his steadfast commitment to his daily walk,
		  and irrigated lawns. I would have never been aware of this colony if
		  🐕 was put off by cloudy and cold weather. We passed the same spot on
		  a later night with similar weather with an even bigger flush having
		  sprouted up from the grass.
