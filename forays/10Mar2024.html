		  This find of
		  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprinellus_micaceus">Coprinellus micaceus</a>
		  is thanks to my dog and his steadfast commitment to his daily walk,
		  and irrigated lawns. I would have never been aware of this colony if
		  üêï was put off by cloudy and cold weather. We passed the same spot on
		  a later night with similar weather with an even bigger flush having
		  sprouted up from the grass.
		</p>
		<p>
		  An update. A tree on a neighbouring property fell during a severe wind
		  storm on the 13th of April. This was one of the few trees in
		  surrounding blocks that was actually blown over. So I strongly suspect
		  the tree was already unhealty and its slowly dying roots is what this
		  colony is feeding on. Either that or the agave on the lawn is the
		  host. Either way the tree fell on the agave and two stumps are all
		  that's left, so I expect loads more mushroomsüçΩ in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
		  A further update. One of my oyster mushroom bags hanging outside
		  started fruiting so I decided to check on the colony again that night
		  and would you believe it another flush had appeared. This was on the
		  16th of April.
