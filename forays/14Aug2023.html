		  Finally found the first mushroom of the foray. The surrounding area
		  was covered in mole hills and collapsed tunnels, and even scat on the

		  I'm unsure if the smaller cap just lacks the gill coloration because
		  of it was still immature. Excuse the terrible print quality, the
		  spores did not drop very well.

		  An identification for this species evades me. I suspect that it grows

		  Some more moss shots. The lighter califlower looking growth is I
		  suspect a type of crustose lichen. The two leafed plant is a

		  species. Compared to other members of the genus, as I later
