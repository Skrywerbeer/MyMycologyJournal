	<h1>Welcome.</h1>
	<p>This is a journal for my fungi collection forays.
	  To grow macro fungi you first need to find some fruiting. Trying to
	  grow micelium you found in the garden has about zero chance of
	  producing a fruit body that you can actually hold in your hand. The only
	  option besides ordering cultures is to collect spores from the wild.
	  Luckily there are pockets of biomass reserves scattered capable of
	  supporting macro fungi in my area. Have a look at what I found so far.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I still need to figure out how to take photos while transplanting small
	  pieces micelium between sterile jars, trying to work as quickly as
	  possible to prevent contamination; all within the cramped space of a dimly
	  lighted oven. With the result that the cultivation page has no content.
